# Wireshark - a boring network analyzing tool?

Labeled by Aleks as a "rather standard" tool with "not much application in hacking", we had a hard time proving the opposite. There are a few astonishing easy to exploit weeknessess of broadcasting networks that can be made visible and it is a great tool to look for a starting point for hacking. So let's dive into it!

## Wireshark in the context of HACKING
Since Wireshark is basically a tool making package traffic in a network visibile it is perfectly suitable for exploiting some weaknessess of broadcasting networks like WiFi. As you might remember: Using WiFi is nothing more than just shouting out loud the information you want to share and hoping that the WiFi router understands it. For us as hackers this means that we can also just listen and maybe gain some valuable insight. A great starting point for gaining something are unencrypted protocols. In the following two intersting widely used protocols will be examined.

### issue #1: unencrypted http
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a widely used application layer protocol for any data exchange in a client-server communication. It furthermore is a connectionless protocol based on the transport layer protocol TCP. Information is exchanged in a stateless request and response cycle. Important request methods are GET, POST and PUT while for example 200 OK is the most common response message. If you want to refresh your knowledge on HTTP you can find a great and short explaination in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA).
