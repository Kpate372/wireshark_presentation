## CVE-2019-6447 Vulnerability

The vulnerability CVE-2019-6447 was published by a hacker with the alias *fs0c131y* and has a CVE v3.0 score of 8.1. A hacker can have access to files or execute applications on the victims phone if he is in the same local network.

Every time a user launches ES File Explore a **hidden HTTP server starts** as well. This server is opening locally the **port 59777**:

```
angler:/ # netstat -ap | grep com.estrongs
tcp6       0      0 :::59777                :::*                    LISTEN      5696/com.estrongs.android.pop
```

Furthermore the server **accepts JSON payloads from unauthenticated sources**:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"command":"[my_awesome_cmd]"}' http://192.168.0.8:59777
```

This allows attackers to gain access of and control over confidential data on the victims phone. The HTTP server is accessible to everybody in the local network and even remains open after the app is closed.
